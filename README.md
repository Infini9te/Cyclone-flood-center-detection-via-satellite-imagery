Project Overview
This project aims to detect and predict cyclone events across New Zealand, Southeast Africa, the Middle East, and Australia using advanced deep learning techniques on satellite imagery. The dataset, comprising imagery from December 2021 to May 2023, was processed using state-of-the-art models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation, VGG-16 for feature extraction, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time-series cyclone prediction.
